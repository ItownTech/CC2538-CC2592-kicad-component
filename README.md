# CC2538-CC2592-kicad-component
This repository contains schematic symbol, pcb footprint, and 3D model for a particular chinese CC2538-CC2592 Zigbee RF module. All files are provided to import the module to Kicad as a new component. 

## Module specification
![module](graphics/module.jpg)
This zigbee RF unit is pretty common, very cheap and easy-to-get from China. A couple of custom zigbee coordinator designs have been made using this part as a base. The applied CC2538 is a stable, powerful zigbee SoC with USB capability, backed up by CC2592 RF frontend. In my opinion, this is the best integrated zigbee RF solution you can get at the moment.
